#### node-inventorysys

This simple node.js project was created for learning porpuses. 
It is a simple inventory system. Users can do all necessarry actions (create, read, update, delete) products, staff, and supplies. 
The system also has a dashboard that shows some statistcs on how many ojects (products, staff, etc) there are, and, the products categories and how many products in each category. 

## They system should not be used in the real world!
I created the system to learn about node.js and the express framework.

Some of the tools used to build the project: 
+Backend:
  +Server language: node.js
  +Framework: express
  +template enjine: ejs
+Database: 
  +MySql
+Frontend: 
  +HTML
